# DIAMOND PRICE PREDICTION USING REGRESSION ANALYSIS


Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project! This repository contains all the necessary resources to develop a machine learning model aimed at predicting the prices of diamonds based on their characteristics.

**Overview**
------------
The goal of this project is to build an accurate and reliable predictive model that can estimate the price of diamonds using regression analysis. The model leverages a dataset containing detailed information about various diamond attributes, such as carat weight, cut quality, and more. This tool is designed to aid buyers, sellers, and industry professionals in making informed pricing decisions.

**Features**
------------
 * Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
 * Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features that significantly impact the pricing.
 * Model Development: Implementing and tuning various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
 * Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
 * Visualization: Graphical representation of data insights and model predictions.
   
**Dataset**
-----------

The dataset used in this project consists of over 219,703 diamond records, providing a rich set of features necessary for accurate price prediction. The data includes comprehensive information on diamond properties and their respective prices.
